MLH in partnership with [porkbun](www.porkbun.com) and [GoDaddy Registry](https://www.tech.study/) provides free domains for all the hackers out there during [MLH events](https://mlh.io/events)

### Problems

1. We can't claim premium domain, so you will get error while applying coupon to premium domains.

2. If you face internet error during checkout of domain, please use Cloudflare Warp.

### Which subdomains to choose ?

1. **.co** : The domain for innovators, entrepreneurs, startups, and creators growing their extraordinary ideas online. It’s a space for inspiration, innovation, taking risks, hustling hard and turning ideas into reality.
2. **.biz** : In this wide-open digital world, .biz stands out as the no frills, straightforward, global TLD that’ll help you kickstart your digital presence. The future of business is here, be a part of it with a .biz domain.
3. **.us** : The web address of choice for anyone with a dream to chase, an idea to share, a cause to champion, or a business to promote. .US welcomes businesses based inside and outside the USA.
4. **.club** : .club is the ideal domain for the social world we live in. Whether it’s a party of 2 or 2000, there’s never been a better time to come together around a common passion and be a part of a club.
5. **.wiki** : Wikis are a uniting force for people with similar interests, and a .wiki domain name invites collaborative energy to your website.
6. **.study** : Empower a global learning community with your research today. A .study domain name is your place online to share your studies and connect with others to promote research, education and learning.
7. **.compare** : Whether you’re an influencer, a blogger or an enthusiastic reviewer, .compare is the online destination for people with knowledge, expertise or experience to help others make informed decisions.
8. **.select** : Your customers know they can select the best on your site with a .select domain. Positions your website as quality right from the start and ensures your users see it as distinct and a class apart.
9. **.design** : A .design domain name lets people know what you do before they even arrive at your website. A .design domain allows you to create a more succinct, powerful, and elegant URL for your business or portfolio.
10. **.courses** : Connect students directly to education courses. Whether you’re a training provider, educational institution, .courses is the quick, easy and memorable way to market your services online.
